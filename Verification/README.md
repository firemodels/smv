##  Smokeview Verification

The smv/Verification/Visualization and smv/Verification/WUI directories contain FDS input files that are run by smokebot 
to verify visualization results of cases run by FDS.  The smokebot script is contained in the
[bot/Smokebot](https://github.com/firemodels/bot/tree/master/Smokebot) directory in the bot repo.

### Introduction 

The Smokeview Verification Suite is a set of FDS and CFAST input files that are designed to test the functionality and accuracy of various Smokeview routines. These cases are run and processed with each maintenance release of Smokeview.  

The Smokeview Verification Suite is run in order to build the Smokeview User and Verification Guides. Most of the User and Verification Guide figures are generated by running Smokeview for these cases.

The input files are located in the Verification\Visualization and Verification\Wui repository directories. Scripts are used to automate this process.
